# KanyeRPG

A game that I made for an introductory computer science class.
You play as Kanye West and you can battle pigs and buy runescape armor

Didn't really know what I was doing when I wrote this lmao

assets are missing, everything was added in one commit,
I don't think it even builds (maybe I'll come back to it)

It's fun to see how far I've come
